Do you write for developers? Here is how to do it in just 10 easy steps!

1. Be super enthusiastic about everything. You're super convinced about how easy, reliable, fast, modern, secure, and overall fabulous the thing you're writing about is. Of course you are, and there is really no need to mention any limitations or shortcomings. No, developers don't need to know about those in advance and they certainly don't want to hear how to work around or avoid them. Leave that for them to figure out! Every developer loves a good, long debugging session at the end of which it turns out the problem has been known about for half a year.

2. Don't get to the point. Seriously, why would you? Why write one paragraph when you can write three? You'll look so much more productive! Why write one sentence when you can write 5? You're being paid by the word after all.

3. Tell us about all the wonderous things you can do with your product, but don't go into detail about how. I won't go into any detail about how to do that. I'm sure you'll figure it out.

4. Be vague! Give us just enough information so that we can almost figure out how to do something but need another hour to dig through Q&A sites to find the missing bits. We love hunting down information in forums. For example, tell us all the steps for using your PaaS with our own domain and SSL certificate, but hide the IP address we're supposed to point our domain to.

5. Tell us we can do something in "3 easy steps". We can't count, so it's important that you tell us how many steps there are. And of course your product is easy to use - never hurts to repeat that in every paragraph.

6. Use terminology wrong, but be subtle about it to create an interesting puzzle for us. Developers love solving puzzles!

7. Metaphors are great. We love metaphors. We don't read enough fiction, so we always appreciate it when the non-fiction we read is written more like fiction.

8. Don't write at all, make it a video! Think about it, videos have so many advantages over written content: You can hide your valuable insights from search engines, because google already knows way too much. You can keep users from scanning a paragraph for a keyword and walk away with just the bit of info they needed. No, you need to make sure they watch the whole thing so that they are properly educated. After all, you want the whole experience to feel a lot like primary school. And last but not least, accessibility is obviously for people with too much time!

9. We love waiting. We wait for presents on christmas, we wait for the next game to come out, waiting adds to the anticipation. So make us wait! Release the product first, and do the documentation later. Then, when the documentation is done, make us wait at least 5 seconds every time we load the page because of all that Javascript you're using to... display text.

10. Did I mention we love solving puzzles? There is hardly ever a better puzzle than a piece of code that doesn't quite work. Maybe there is a missing import we need to hunt down or the library the code is using has changed the name of a method but the code snippet wasn't updated. Or maybe, just maybe, the code runs fine on one OS but fails silently on another.
